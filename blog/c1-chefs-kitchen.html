        <p> I'm really looking forward to the whole DBC experience, instead of just learning how to code. Two things that really appeals to me now after watching Shereef's video: 1) We are going there not to learn the how to place the bricks, but instead, learn to do an entire building from the ground up with the best practices available. It is about learning how to engineer an application, not just type it down. 2) The DBC process forces you interact with other people while learning and working, by peer programming, giving and taking constant feedbacks, group work, and engineering empathy course. Even though I'm not planning to take a job as a developer right after bootcamp, those are skills I can translate to any area in my life, including my current job and personal relations.</p>

        <p> I'm a little bit nervous, yes, like I think everyone else should be. But I'm really more in a excitement state. I like these intensive learning experiences, it's actually how I acquired almost all new skills in life. The beggining of the learning curve is always very messy and intense, and it surely helps if you block a few weeks, adopt an obsessive mindset for learn and immerse yourself in the kind of environment that will help you get ahead fast.</p>
				<p>Phase 0 is also looking pretty neat. Congrats for devbootcamp to keeping it all so organized, I was not expecting this much, it was a really good surprise. In just one week there are a whole of new things going on, from command line, to twitter, blogging, mastering sublime and git, and various techniques to learn and produce better. And the teaching style is also something I'm finding interesting, and will certainly adopt a lot of these techniques on my own classes.</p>
				<p>Oddly, and last, I'm looking forward for daily Yoga classes! Really! Yoga is something I've practiced for a while, I've always wanted to do it on a daily basis, but never cleared the timeslots for it. I got a pretty bad back injury a few months back, and I have been unable to practice sports for the last 4 months, so 2 months of yoga will be a smooth way to help me get back in shape for my sports practice when I go back to Brazil.</p>
