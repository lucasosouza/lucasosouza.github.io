<!-- This template is in markdown, not html, so
  it will not render beautifully when you copy and
  paste it into your github.io site, but it will at
  least be published. Next week you'll be creating a
  blog template using HTML and CSS and you'll be able

  to copy and paste the blog posts from week 1 in there
  to make them pretty next week.

  For now, please replace the title, subtitle (if desired),
  and date with the text you would like. Markdown is pretty
  simple, so you can just feel free to type. =) You'll want
  to delete this chunk of a comment as well. -->

On version control, Github and collaboration

01/11/2014

Version Control is about keeping track of all the changes you've done to a file. If you don't know any better way, you are probably doing that by renaming multiple copies of the file with a v1.0 or vNumber in front of them.

Git helps you do that in an easier way. Any time you do a change on a file, you can commit that change. Git will take a snapshot of the file in that current status. And you can access an older version or rollback to that snapshot any time you like. You can also create several different branches of your project, like multiple concurring versios. You can work on each without affecting the master branch, where the original application is, and then merge back the modifications you made after you are sure your changes are working and required.

There is also another great tool called GitHub. It leverages on git capabilities by creating an online environment, where you can save your files, and track your changes just like you would do in your computer, but "in the cloud". Being online, you can also share that repository with colleagues, so multiple people can access and commit changes to that directory.

Github is widely used by open source community to collaborate on projects. It allows a tight control of what is added, changed or removed from the application, by leaning on peer control. When you want to collaborate, you have to either fork the code to your repository, to create a local copy, or create a new branch. You can then request to merge back your changes into the project, and it will  be reviewed by another peer before it is merged.

So, don't just stay there staring, get started! Access github.com, create your account, and take a look at the many open source projects going on. You can dive in and learn, and when you are ready to help, fork the repository and start collaborating with this awesome vibrant community.
