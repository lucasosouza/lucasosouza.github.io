      When I started learning CSS, I realized this is concept the most useful a begginer can grasp. And it is quite easy to understand and use it. Before we enter explanations, take a look at this image, borrowed from W3Schools. It says everything :
      </p>

      <div class="imagebox">

      </div>

      <p>
      Think your webpage is like a onion. No, no, erase that, bad analogy. Think your webpage is a gift (much better!). Your mother's birthday is coming up. So you decide to buy her a cassete player, so she can listen to her old times favorite tape, "ABBA Greatest hits". Then, to protect the player, you wisely choose to safeguard it in a nice wooden box, and you stuff the box with shredded newspaper so nothing happens to the cassete player. That still don't look like a gift, though. So you wrap the wooden box in a nice colored paper you bought at the local convenience store. Looking good now. So, at last, to make it a big surprise(!), you hide it in her top drawer along with her other jewelries.
      </p>

      So, think a little bit about this story. What does it have to do with CSS, margin, border and padding? The cassete player is your <strong>content</strong>. The player is inside a container, the wooden box. All the empty space between the cassete and the wooden box walls, which you filled with shredded newspaper, is the <strong>padding</strong>. You also wrapped the container in a nice colored gift paper, which is your <strong>border</strong>. And finally, you put it in a bigger container, the drawer(aka the webpage). The empty space between the drawer and the wooden box is the <strong>margin</strong>. Confusing? I hope not.
      </p>
      <p>
      This is called the <strong>CSS Box Model</strong>. Just remember the analogy any time you're putting a cassete player, I mean a content, into your webpage. You got three layers between your content and the page: first the empty space between the content and the border, which is called padding; then the border; then the margin. Manipulate those attributes freely to reach the formatting style you want.
